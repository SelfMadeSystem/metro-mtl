# Metro MTL

[Metro MTL](https://metro-mtl.ca) is an open-source project providing travel information for the Montreal Metro system that the STM (Société de transport de Montréal) does not provide.

## Goals and non-goals

Primary goals of the project are:

- Provide detailed layout of the metro system, including exits, transfer corridors, and accessibility information.
- Help users chose the right door when boarding a train for optimal exits and transfers. (Inspired by the Seoul Metro that has numbered doors etc.)
- Provide all the STM's official maps and other information for each station.
- Easy to use and mobile-friendly website.

Non-goals of the project are:

- Provide real-time information about train arrivals and service disruptions.
  - The STM only provides real-time information for their buses, not for the metro system.
- Provide trip planning functionality.
  - You can already use Google Maps, [chrono](https://chronoapp.quebec/) (the ARTM's official app), [Transit](https://transitapp.com/), or any number of other apps for that.
- Provide information about bus routes or other transit systems.

Perhaps in the future:

- Provide information about the REM (Réseau express métropolitain) system.
- Provide information about commuter trains.
